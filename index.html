                <h4>Babies and Basilisks: An Asymmetric VR Party Game</h4>
                <p>
                    This was my capstone project in college, which I worked on with a group of four teammates
                    for the duration of our senior year. One VR-wearing player builds a level for up to four other 
                    players to navigate through. These players can choose from four characters with unique abilities, 
                    while the VR player tries to stop them by placing enemies and traps, and controlling a boss. I was
                    one of two engineers on the team, and my biggest contributions included the VR level building system,
                    a secondary audio system enabling non-VR players to hear different audio than the VR player,
                    and a visual state machine editor in Unity that was used to build the enemy AI.

                <h4>Astral Horizon: A Science Fiction FPS</h4>
                <p>
                    Astral Horizon is my current personal hobby project. It is a story-focused FPS in an original
                    SciFi setting. I am still in a fairly early phase of development due to this being something I
                    only work on in my free time, but I already have solid core mechanics implemented. Current features
                    include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>6-DOF flying movement.</li>
                        <li>Grounded movement on surfaces pointing in any direction.</li>
                        <li>Multiple weapon and grenade types.</li>
                        <li>Multiple enemy types including a miniboss.</li>
                        <li>Sections in oxygen and in vacuum - this affects sound, enemy detection, and the player's oxygen level.</li>
                        <li>AI squadmates with several different orders the player can give.</li>
                        <li>A custom 3D navigation system that enemies and squadmates can use when in 6-DOF flying mode.</li>
                        <li>A text-based dialogue system.</li>
                    </ul>
                   I stream development of Astral Horizon most Saturdays on 
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/infohazardgames">Twitch</a> and save the streams on

                <h4>Foresight: A Surveillance-Themed Detective Game</h4>
                <p>
                    I worked with a team of four other people my junior year of college to make Foresight,
                    a detective game about government surveillance. Set during the later years of the Cold War,
                    Foresight tasks the player with identifying criminals and Soviet spies by searching through 
                    various pieces of private information in gameplay inspired by <i>Papers, Please</i>. In this
                    project, I was the main engineer.

                <h4>Wolf in Shepherd's Clothing: A Survival Crafting Card Game</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout college, I made a lot of small games at game jams. I made this game with a friend from
                    college, about a year after graduating, for the 2020 GMTK Game Jam. The theme for this game jam was "Out of Control".
                    In Wolf in Shepherd's Clothing, you play as a farmer who is also a werewolf. You must manage your farm, go exploring,
                    and craft items in order to keep your werewolf-self at bay, and eventually cure your lycanthropy. At night, you draw
                    cards to determine what your werefolf-self will do, and as the game advances, the number of werewolf cards you have to
                    draw each night increases. For this game jam, I was one of two engineers, and additionally did all of the 3D art.

                <h4>Divided: A Minimalistic Puzzle Game</h4>
                <p>
                    I made Divided with one other team member for a game design class in my junior year of college.
                    Divided was an exercise in constraint, since the micro-engine the game was made in is limited
                    to a small grid of simple shapes. It is a simple but challenging puzzle game where the player must
                    navigate a bead through a sequence of levels, often splitting into two or more beads, some of which
                    have inversted controls.

                <h4>Supernova: A Space Combat FPS</h4>
                <p>
                    A space combat game I made during my freshman year of college.
                    Working on this project was a major part of how I taught myself Unity and Blender.
                    In Supernova, the player can take control of five different ships:
                    A small fighter or bomber, or the much larger frigate, destroyer, and carrier.
                    From a single ship, they take part in a battle between two much larger fleets,
                    with all other ships acting autonomously. In addition to building all of the tech,
                    I also made all the 3D models in the game in Blender.
