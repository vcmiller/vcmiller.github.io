                <h4>Babies and Basilisks: An Asymmetric VR Party Game</h4>
                <p>
                    This was my capstone project in college, which I worked on with a group of four teammates
                    for the duration of our senior year. One VR-wearing player builds a level for up to four other 
                    players to navigate through. These players can choose from four characters with unique abilities, 
                    while the VR player tries to stop them by placing enemies and traps, and controlling a boss.

                <h4>Supernova: A Space Combat FPS</h4>
                <p>
                    A space combat game I made during my freshman year of college. 
                    In Supernova, the player can take control of five different ships:
                    A small fighter or bomber, or the much larger frigate, destroyer, and carrier.
                    From a single ship, they take part in a battle between two much larger fleets,
                    with all other ships acting autonomously.

                <h4>Foresight: A Surveillance-Themed Detective Game</h4>
                <p>
                    I worked with a team of four other people my junior year of college to make Foresight,
                    a detective game about government surveillance. Set during the later years of the Cold War,
                    Foresight tasks the player with identifying criminals and Soviet spies by searching through 
                    various pieces of private information in gameplay inspired by <i>Papers, Please</i>.

                <h4>Late Stage Cap-italism: A Hat-Thieving Stealth Game</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout college, I made a lot of small games at game jams. I made this game with a friend from
                    college, shortly after graduating, for the 2019 GMTK Game Jam. In Late Stage Cap-italism, you
                    run a hat shop that has only one hat, and must steal the hat back from your customers each night
                    in a colorful isometric stealth game.

                <h4>Divided: A Minimalistic Puzzle Game</h4>
                <p>
                    I made Divided with one other team member for a game design class in my junior year of college.
                    Divided was an exercise in constraint, since the micro-engine the game was made in is limited
                    to a small grid of simple shapes.
